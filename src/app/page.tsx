									Bittensor is not just a blockchain; it&apos;s a groundbreaking
									network that fosters decentralized intelligence, where a
									consensus mechanism rewards the creation and sharing of AI
									models. This neural network of nodes, maintained by
									independent miners, promotes a cooperative space for AI
									services to be developed and utilized worldwide. At Taoshi, we
									harness Bittensor&apos;s capabilities to build specialized
									subnetworks, like our{" "}

									we contribute to a decentralized AI marketplace, powered by
									the Bittensor token ($TAO), to ensure the seamless exchange of
									data and intelligence. Taoshi serves as a gateway to this new
									era of accessible, incentivized intelligence, where every
