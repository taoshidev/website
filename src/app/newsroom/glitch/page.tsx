          Glitch Roadmap: From Alpha to Full Launch
        </Text>
        <Text mb="lg">
          Glitch&apos;s platform is currently in a closed alpha, providing a
          select group of users with initial access for testing. This phase
          focuses on gathering feedback on user experience, functionality, and
          performance. Following the alpha, a beta release is planned for early
          Q1 2025, expanding access to early adopters and partnered wealth
          managers. Improvements based on user feedback will ensure stability as
          more waitlisted users are onboarded, with a full launch anticipated by
          the end of Q1 2025.

          What Sets Glitch Apart
        </Text>
        <Text mb="lg">
          Glitch distinguishes itself by offering sophisticated AI-based trading
          strategies that require no extensive user knowledge or experience in
          trading. As a non-custodial platform, it allows users to maintain full
          control over their funds while providing a user-friendly interface for
          seamless integration into existing brokerage and exchange accounts.
        </Text>
        <Text mb="lg">
          Glitch&apos;s mission is to democratize wealth generation by making
          institutional-grade trading strategies accessible to the masses. The
          platform addresses the lack of high-performing automated trading
          solutions for individual investors by offering advanced AI-based
          strategies that are even more sophisticated than those typically
          available to institutional investors. Its plug-and-play interface
          simplifies automation, enabling users to implement these strategies
          without prior trading knowledge.
